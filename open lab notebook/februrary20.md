# Analysis of physiological data
-20201202
- I finished analysing the samples of Cortisol, Alpha-Amylase and Heartrate and added the notebooks containig the statistic analysis into the 'Code'- Folder.
- A few questions arised looking at the results.
I conducted a mixed ANOVA (split-plot ANOVA) for all three datatypes after testing for normal distribution, homoscedacity and sphericity.
In none of the three analysis a significant interaction between the groups showed up.
Nevertheless, looking at the descriptive statistics, it seems as if for both (cortisol and amylase) already between timepoint 2 and 3 (time where the first stress test was conducted and where the paradigm for both conditions(water and music) were the same) the groups start to go apart only for then having a paralell continuity. This indicates, that independent from the project paradigm, an influence on the data took place. (instruction during stress test differs, Versuchsleiter changes etc)
- Next I will try to find this interaction as well as finish analysing the analysis of respiration-data.
